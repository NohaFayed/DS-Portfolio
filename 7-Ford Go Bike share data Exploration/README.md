-Project Description:
In this project, Exploratory data visualization was used to understand the patterns and relationships present in the data. This understanding helped me approach any statistical analyses and build conclusions and findings. This process also illuminated additional data cleaning tasks to be performed. Also, Explanatory data visualization techniques were used after generating the findings, and were used to help communicate the results.
