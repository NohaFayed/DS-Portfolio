-Project Description:
In this project, I analyzed TMDb movie dataset and then communicate my findings about it. I investigated problems in the dataset and wrangled the data into a format I can use. I used the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier. I went through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together.
